# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Initialize a clean, themed baseline app with a single English landing page that confirms the project is ready for further feature development.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single coherent landing screen containing an app title, short tagline/description, and one primary call-to-action button with placeholder (non-breaking) behavior.
- Define and apply a cohesive visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, component styling) using Tailwind and existing UI components, avoiding blue/purple as the primary palette.
- Add required generated static images under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and render them directly on the landing page via static asset paths.

**User-visible outcome:** The app loads without errors into a themed landing page showing the title, tagline, a primary button (placeholder), and two static visuals (hero background and app mark).
